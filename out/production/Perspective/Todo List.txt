3D
- 3d graphics 								                        done needs improvement later
- rotating the world 							                    done
- displaying the 2d world in slice 					                done
- transition to 2d animation						                work in progress
- movement in 3d                                                    done
- transition between levels                                         done

2D
- character movement system						                    done
- collision with walls							                    done
- 2d graphics 								                        done needs improvement later
- different types of cubes  (different intersections with player)	work in progress


3D-2D
3d to 2d grid flattening                                            done
2d to 3d player position calculation                                done


Known bugs: (if you find a bug please report it here with a good description of why or when it happens)
- player disappears when transitioned into a direction where player cannot be seen      not started
- player can fly while moving in 3d world                                               not started
- movement sound has a delay at the start, so it feels unnatural when player moves
repeatedly. sound file should be edited.                                                not started
